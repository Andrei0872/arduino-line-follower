## Team members

The video showcasing the functionality(or at least a part of it) can be found [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/NF3iMSwg8Gc?feature=share).

## Challenges

* trying to understand the _why_ behind the formula we've used for making the robot move properly(in the end, we weren't very successful)
* trying to make the calibration as accurate as possible(in the end, we went with a contrived approach that, honestly, could be called anything else but calibration)
